Please input 3 integers, separated by spaces.

These numbers represent the number of buses, cars, and motorcycles you would like to park, respectively.
If you would like to unpark (remove) vehicles, enter negative numbers.
For example, if I wanted to unpark 4 buses, not change the number of cars, and park 12 motorcycles,
I would enter "-4 0 12".

Note that unparking occurs first, then parking occurs in the order of bus, car, and motorcycle.
If you want to park 1 motorcycle before 1 bus and 1 car, please enter "0 0 1", then "1 1 0".
To switch to smart parking, type "0 0 0".
