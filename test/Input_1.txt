/* Explaining input:

         0 : use default values for garage size and percentages
   2 30 60 : park 2 buses, 30 cars, 60 motorcycles
-1 -10 -20 : unpark 1 bus, 10 cars, 20 motorcycles
     0 0 0 : switch to smart parking
 + C 4 0 2 : park a car on level 4, row 0, space 2
 + B 4 0 4 : park a bus on level 4, row 0, space 4 (I expect this to do nothing because there is not room for a bus after the car we just parked.)
 + B 3 0 4 : park a bus when there is insufficient room to the right, but sufficient room to the right and left of given index
 - B 3 0 2 : remove a bus from weird (not an end or the center) index
         0 : switch back to regular parking
   4 0 -15 : unpark 15 motorcycles, then park 4 buses (there should only be room for 3, but the program just says "No room." instead of crashing)
