Proceeding with: 
   5 levels
   30 spaces per level
   10 spaces per row
   20 percent large spaces
   60 percent compact spaces
   20 percent motorcycle spaces

Your empty garage has been generated.
This garage approximates the number of large, compact, and motorcycle spots from the given percentages.

Please input 3 integers, separated by spaces.

These numbers represent the number of buses, cars, and motorcycles you would like to park, respectively.
If you would like to unpark (remove) vehicles, enter negative numbers.
For example, if I wanted to unpark 4 buses, not change the number of cars, and park 12 motorcycles,
I would enter "-4 0 12".

Note that unparking occurs first, then parking occurs in the order of bus, car, and motorcycle.
If you want to park 1 motorcycle before 1 bus and 1 car, please enter "0 0 1", then "1 1 0".
To switch to smart parking, type "0 0 0".

Now using smart park.
Enter '0' instead of '+' or '-' to return to regular parking.
