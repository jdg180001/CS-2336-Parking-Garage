# Parking-Garage
C++ project displaying fundamentals of object oriented programming

A UML diagram is included in doc/.

The project simulates a parking garge displayed in ASCII. Console input allows the user to "park" and "unpark" differently sized vehicles.
Instructions for how to input are printed at runtime, but if you don't want to interact with the program (or want to see edge cases that
I've already considered) then I have included three sample inputs/outputs in test/.

My algorithm for parking attempts to optimize capacity by not allowing smaller vehicles to "waste" the consecutive spaces required for a bus.
